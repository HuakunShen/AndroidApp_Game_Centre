# Phase 2

## Notes

* Teams can be reformed. Everyone can use code from their previous team.
* If code is borrowed, cite that group's group number.

## Task

1. Write JUnit tests that test the app with Code coverage tool.
2. Research for how to avoid non-solvable boards, and fix the bug.
3. Add 2 more games, make sure the scoreboard features accommodate them.
4. At least 1 game must have automatic save points of some kind. (?) At least one game has to have undo function.
5. Use design patterns.
6. Refactor code.

## Styles

* Clean up code smells
* Follow naming convention
* Reformat code
* All variables must be private, only use setters and getters when needed
* Avoid using keyword static whenever possible, except for __static final__

## Presentation

* Presentation <= 15 minutes
* Presentation at the end of the term, with 2 TA's
* TA ask question for at least 5 minutes
* Each person may be asked about code, test cases, design patterns and other implementation details
* Each member must speak for at least 2.5 minutes in the 15 minutes presentation
* Commit a file called __WALKTHROUGH.pdf__ that contains outline of the presentation that covers
  * What is unit test coverage?
  * What are the most important classes in out program?
  * What design patterns we used? And which problem do each of them solve?
  * How is scoreboard designed? Where are high scores stored? How do they get displayed?
* Every group member should be ready to be questioned

## Team and Individual Marks

* Every team member could have the same mark
* But based on git logs, TA observation, and presentation, individual's mark may be adjusted downward
