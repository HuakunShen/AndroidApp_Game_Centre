Working Policy:

At the beginning of phase 2, Xu Wang, Weiqing Wang and Huakun Shen focused on writing Sudoku game, Yuan Xu and Jiatao Xiang focused on writing Picture Match game.

After basic functions of both games were completed, everyone works on any thing as needed. Basically, whoever finds a bug fix it. When large modification is needed, we discuss with the member who wrote it then modify codes together.
